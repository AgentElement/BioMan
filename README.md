# BioMan
This Bio Manufatcuring Simulator is composed of two files: (1) BM_Factory.py (2) BM_Toolbox.py Please directly run BM_Factory.py for the condition to choose in experiment design.

## Benchmarking
To run a benchmark test, use the following command:

python3 BM_Factory_Benchmarker.py *n*

Where *n* is some integer value that indicates how many times in a row to run the simulator.

**Note:** Initial estimates say 1 run of the simulator takes about 25-41 seconds.
